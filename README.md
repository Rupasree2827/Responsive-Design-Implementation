Description:

Designing a Responsive Webpage Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
The goal of this task is to design and implement a responsive webpage that seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes and devices. Responsiveness is a critical aspect of modern web development because users access websites through a wide range of devices, from large desktop monitors to tablets and smartphones with much smaller screens. A responsive webpage automatically adjusts its layout, images, text, and interactive elements to provide an optimal viewing experience regardless of the device used.
